# TODO

### Plan
1. GameRestorer - load any step
1. PROBLEM: take god has same value as on hero position

### NEW Ideas

1. Introduce tactic disabler (isApplicable?)
1. AvoidStrong must also return from 0 to 1000 as a distance to another hero

## Ideas

Tactic returns from 0 to 1000
Tactic can't calculate from goals
Coefficents must differ to avoid move cycling
However another mechanism avoiding cycling also must be in place 
(randomizing? or just trying to avoid place where you have been already)
